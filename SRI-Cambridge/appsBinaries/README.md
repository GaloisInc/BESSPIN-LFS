# Compiled BESSPIN applications

This directory contains the applications binaries for the FETT bug bounty in summer 2020. Please refer to the [bug bounty documentation](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite/tree/master/docs/bugBounty2020).

The webserver, database, and voting related binaries are already included in the FreeBSD disk image. Additionally, this directory has the Kernel GDB binary. More details about their implementation and how to reproduce and use the CHERI binaries are provided [on the CHERI website](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/).
