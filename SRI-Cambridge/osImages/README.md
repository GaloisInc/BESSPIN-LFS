# OS Images

This directory has the CheriBSD kernel binaries and disk images. The AWS F1 (Connectal) ones were used in the [FETT bug bounty](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite/tree/master/docs/bugBounty2020). Also, Qemu binaries are provided for testing. Details about building CheriBSD can be found in the [CheriBSD repo](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd).
