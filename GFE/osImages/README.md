# OS Images

The GFE Unix Images are built using the Nixos package manager as detailed [here](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Environment/blob/master/IMAGES.md). There are subtle differences for the binaries to work on different backends due to mainly memory devices and hardware drivers.

The FreeRTOS binaries are the ones used for the [FETT bug bounty](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite/tree/master/docs/bugBounty2020), and they are built using the [Tool-Suite](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite).
