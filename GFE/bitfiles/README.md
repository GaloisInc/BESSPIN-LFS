# Bitfiles

This directory contains the GFE processors bitstreams and their auxiliary files.

The AWS F1 files, FireSim and Connectal, were built for the FETT bug bounty in summer 2020. Please check the [bug bounty documentation](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite/tree/master/docs/bugBounty2020) and the [cloudGFE documentation](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-CloudGFE) for more details.

The Xilinx VCU118 bitstreams were built as the baseline processors for the SSITH work to be built above them. More details about these builds are in the main [GFE repo](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-GFE). The files themselves are copied here from the Nix environment, which copies the files over from a fixed revision of the GFE repository.
