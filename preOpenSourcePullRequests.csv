GaloisInc/BESSPIN-LFS,PR,117,brooksdavis,"Background: Tags are stored in a two-level hierarchy to exploit
non-uniform distribution of tags and reduce DRAM traffic, with the top
level being a summary tag bit for a ""group"" of capabilities. On reset,
just this top level is zeroed, with the leaves lazily zeroed.

Bug: When a capability with the tag bit set was first stored to a given
group, thereby flipping the top-level bit from 0 to 1, a numeric error
led to only half of the leaf bits for the group being zeroed, meaning
reading a capability from the upper half of the group would see the
tag as whatever was already in DRAM. This error was introduced when
adding support for 128-bit capabilities with a 64-bit bus, as used by
CHERI on RV64, likely due to confusion about what the 8 on the line in
question meant (it's a bits to bytes conversion, nothing to do with the
capability size in bytes).

Fix: Change the 16 back to an 8.

- I went with the second approach from DARPA-SSITH-Demonstrators/BESSPIN-CloudGFE#62, with a directory at the top level for each source of binaries. I can change this if people think that a different structure is better.
- I'm not sure if it makes sense putting our own OS images in this repo, as they are already part of our Nix environment, which makes it very easy to make changes. The FETT tool could have a configurable option to search for images in the Nix environment if they are not present here.
- Images and bitfiles should have some naming scheme which should be documented in the README.
