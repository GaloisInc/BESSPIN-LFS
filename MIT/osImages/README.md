# OS Images

There is only one image, which is the Linux Debian image for Connectal (on AWS F1) that was used on the MIT processor for the [FETT bug bounty](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-Tool-Suite/tree/master/docs/bugBounty2020).

Details about building this image are provided in [this repo](https://github.com/mit-enclaves/linux).
